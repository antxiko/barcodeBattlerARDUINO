# Barcode Battler READER
# Atmega328p & Raspberry PI Pico Compatible

Connect a Barcode Battler to an Arduino UNO and read the info cards readed in "CONNECTION MODE" of the Barcode Battler.

The code is commented and is very simple.

Used the info from http://barcodebattler.co.uk/index2.php to make this working.

Work in progress to support more MCUs.
